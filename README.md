Pro(n) Penetration
==================

In high school I attempted to access adult web sites without paying for them.
There used to be a whole scene for that, maybe there still is. (I always did it
for personal use and never distribution.) Here are the access scripts for
successful attempts.

Be surprised if anything here still works, I havenâ€™t tested them in years. But
they should be interesting for aspiring security researchers and people
interested in the scene. If you find any working passwords or something that is
an active threat, let me know and I'll remove them immediately!

Includes:

-   Site access, download scripts

-   Cataloging, sorting scripts

-   Takeover, admin access, server infrastructure files

Of course NSFW.
